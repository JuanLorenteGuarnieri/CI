# Advanced Computational Imaging (ACI)

## Course Overview
The *Advanced Computational Imaging* course focuses on the study and application of advanced and emerging techniques in computational imaging. Students will design and implement algorithmic solutions while exploring state-of-the-art methods and open problems in the field. Additionally, they will develop the skills to present acquired knowledge and work independently or in teams.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will have acquired the following competencies:

- Understanding hardware and key principles of advanced computational imaging systems.
- Mastery of advanced imaging algorithms and techniques based on photon and wave capture, propagation, and processing.
- Knowledge of the latest applications of computational imaging.
- Development of advanced algorithmic solutions for various imaging applications.
